			The Indian Premier League's (IPL) Bengaluru-based cricket team is called Royal
			Challengers Bangalore (also known as RCB). United Spirits Limited, a member of the
			Diageo Group, is the team's owner. RCB improved from being in the bottom two in 2008 to
			place second in 2009 and reach the semifinals in 2010. When they reached the final in
			2011, the team had three consecutive successful seasons. Royal Challengers Bangalore,
			led by Virat Kohli, finished second once more in 2016. <br /><br />RCB made the playoffs
			in 2022 thanks to the capable guidance of Director of Cricket Operations Mike Hesson,
			Head Coach Sanjay Bangar, and captain Faf du Plessis; the team has now accomplished this
			accomplishment for a third straight season. The team is made up of a superb mix of
			established talents in the world stage and up-and-comers. The international talents
			include people like Josh Hazlewood, Wanindu Hasaranga, Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli,
			Dinesh Karthik, Glenn Maxwell, andsquad has fostered and produced great homegrown talent
			over the past few years. Shahbaz Ahmed just received his first call-up to the national
			squad, while two superb fast bowlers, Harshal Patel and Mohammed Siraj, have progressed
			to being a regular component for squad India across multiple forms. <br /><br />In line
			with the motto "Defeats don't defeat us, the Challenger Spirit keeps us alive," RCB has
			embraced the #PlayBold ethos.
